- Large sections of coastal roads will become flooded, or
wash-out altogether.
- Severe beach erosion is expected with significant dune
loss. Sands from displaced dunes will likely deposit onto
the barrier island roads.
- Major damage to marinas, docks, boardwalks, and piers is
possible. Many small craft broken away from moorings,
especially in unprotected anchorages with some lifted
onshore and stranded inland.
- Navigation may be difficult, especially near inlets and
waterways, as some navigational aids may be off station or
missing. Debris is possible in the waterways and other
navigable channels.

* FLOODING RAIN
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Peak Rainfall Amounts: Additional 10-15 inches, with
locally higher amounts

- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for extreme
flooding rain
- The flooding rain threat has increased from the previous
assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for
extreme flooding from heavy rain. Evacuations and rescues
are likely.
- PREPARE: Urgently consider protective actions from extreme
and widespread rainfall flooding.
- ACT: Heed any flood watches and warnings. Failure to take
action will likely result in serious injury or loss of life.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Devastating to Catastrophic
- Extreme flooding from rainfall may prompt numerous
evacuations and rescues.
- Rivers and streams may overwhelmingly overflow their banks
with deep moving water. Creeks and ditches will become
severely flooded and contain strong currents.
- Flood waters may enter numerous structures, and some may
become uninhabitable or washed away. Road scours or
complete road failure is likely in many locations, along
with the potential for sinkholes. Many streets and parking
lots will flood, and may be impacted by swift, flowing
water. Numerous road and low-lying bridge closures are
likely with some weakened or washed away. Driving
conditions will be very dangerous.
- The delivery of drinking water and sewer services may be
interrupted. Flood waters may be polluted and contain
hazardous materials.

* TORNADO
- LATEST LOCAL FORECAST:
- Situation is somewhat favorable for tornadoes

- POTENTIAL THREAT TO LIFE AND PROPERTY: Potential for a few
tornadoes
- The tornado threat has remained nearly steady from the
previous assessment.
- PLAN: Emergency plans should include the potential for a
few tornadoes.
- PREPARE: If your shelter is particularly vulnerable to
tornadoes, prepare to relocate to safe shelter before
hazardous weather arrives.
- ACT: If a tornado warning is issued, be ready to shelter
quickly.

- POTENTIAL IMPACTS: Limited
- The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the
execution of emergency plans during tropical events.
- A few places may experience tornado damage, along with
power and communications disruptions.
- Tornadoes can cause damage to trees, vehicles, boats, and
buildings. Unsecured mobile homes and poorly constructed
structures are particularly vulnerable.
